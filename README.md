## Dataset:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

---


### Question 1:
Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn datasets and show all target names and features.

Read the documentation for the dataset, this will help
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html


### Question 2: 
Visualize the data (scatter) from mean radius and mean smoothness so it shows what characterizes a malignant breast mass from a benign breast mass. Explain what you see.


### Question 3: <font color=red>(Red Assignment)</font>
Visualize breast mass feature importance.
<br>
Show which breast mass features that weigh the most in breast cancer detection.

### Review Question 1:

Was data loaded and target names and features shown correctly?
<br>
Use datasetname.DESCR to see info about a dataset to verify


### Review Question 2:

Was the data visualized in a meaningful way (different colors & labels) with mean radius and mean smoothness?
<br>
Does the explaination describe the visualization in an understandable way? If not why not?


### Review Question 3:

Was the feature importance visualized showing the features that are the most important for breast cancer detection?
<br>
Was RandomForestClassifier used? If not what was used instead?
